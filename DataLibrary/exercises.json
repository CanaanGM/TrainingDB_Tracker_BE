    "howTo": "1. Sit on the ab crunch machine and adjust the seat height so that the pads rest comfortably against your chest and thighs.\n2. Grasp the handles or place your hands on the pads provided.\n3. Engage your core and begin the movement by curling your torso forward, bringing your chest towards your knees.\n4. Focus on contracting your abdominal muscles as you crunch forward.\n5. Hold the contraction for a moment at the bottom of the movement.\n6. Slowly return to the starting position with control, extending your torso back to the upright position.\n7. Repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions.",

    "howTo": "Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand, one with an overhand grip and the other with an underhand grip. Engage your core and lift one knee towards your chest in a marching motion, then lower it back down and repeat with the other leg. Continue marching in place, maintaining a steady pace and keeping your torso upright. Switch the grip of the weights halfway through the set.",
